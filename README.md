# API_Test

- Attempting to follow the Google C++ standard

- Will be used to quickly test API concepts or calls
- Plan, write a script in python that will serve as the API endpoint
    - This endpoint will then appear as an api to the outside user

- Currently using logging to cout and c++ memory management
    - Will optimize later
